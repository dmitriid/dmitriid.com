- click comments -> click view responses
- no. of comments only available at the comment bubble, not in responses button
- external links: click -> opens comment, cmd+click -> opens external in same tab, right click -> open new tab -> opens comment in tab
- no way to see just stories for a user

All these are *deliberate* product choices, not rookie mistakes.

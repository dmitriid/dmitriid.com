# You want New Year's Resolutions? Ain't Got Them

I used to come up [with](https://www.facebook.com/notes/dmitrii-mamut-dimandt/new-years-resolutions-in-february-/10153750312131049) [resolutions](https://www.facebook.com/dmitriid/notes?lst=684781048%3A684781048%3A1483345301) in the past couple of years. This year, however, I have none. I have something more important. Well, somethin more important to me.

I've gottent rid of a few childhood anxieties and complexes :)
